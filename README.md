# Module-5-Assignment
Pymaceuticals, Inc. began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. We conducted a study of 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured, as the mice were administered various treatments with Capomulin being one.

We can conclude from our study that the average tumor volume in mice treated by Capomulin was the second lowest (40.68 mm3) out of all of  the drugs tested. 

The final tumor volume in mice treated with Capomulin and Ramicane were much lower than the final tumor volume in mice treated with Infubinol and Ceftamin. 

Taking a random sample of a mouse treated by Capomulin, we observed that the tumor size decreased from 45 mm3 at the beginning of the study, to 41.5 at the end of the study. 

Capomulin was tested on 230 mice, the most of all the drugs tested. This higher sample size might have an effect on the outcome of the study.
